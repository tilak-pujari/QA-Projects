# Projects
## OpenCart Automation Project
This project is based on Java-Selenium technology to automate the demo website of OpenCart, an open-source e-commerce platform. The project covers various functionalities of the website, such as:

Registration of new user
Login of existing user
Browsing different menus
Searching products
Entering address details
Adding products into cart and validating cart
Checkout
The project uses ChromeDriver as the web driver and JUnit as the testing framework. The project also generates an automation report using Extend Report1. The project follows the page object model (POM) design pattern and uses annotations to mark test methods.

The project can be used to demonstrate the skills and knowledge of Java-Selenium automation testing and to practice test cases on a realistic e-commerce website

## Actitime Demo WebSite Automation

Registration of new user
Login of existing user
Enter Time Track Sheet
Searching Users
Entering address details

The project uses ChromeDriver as the web driver and TestNG as the testing framework. The project also generates an automation report using Extend Report1. The project follows the page object model (POM) design pattern and uses annotations to mark test methods.Build with Maven tool


## nopCommerce Automation Project

This project is a Selenium-based automated testing framework for nopCommerce, an open-source e-commerce platform. The project leverages the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which enables structured and maintainable test code by separating page objects from test logic, enhancing reusability and scalability1.

The project uses Java as the programming language, Maven as the build tool, TestNG as the testing framework. The project also supports parallel testing using Selenium webdriver.

The project covers various functionalities of the website, such as:
Registration of new user
Login of existing user
Browsing different categories
Searching products
Adding products to wishlist and cart

The project can be used to demonstrate the skills and knowledge of Selenium automation testing and to practice test cases on a realistic e-commerce website

## HerokuApp Automation Testing

This project is a Java Selenium TestNG framework for automating the testing of various web applications hosted on HerokuApp. It uses Maven as a build tool and generates HTML reports using Extent Reports.

### Features ###
- Supports cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox and Edge
- Implements Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
- Uses TestNG annotations and parameters for test configuration and execution
- Includes data-driven testing using Excel files
- Handles common web elements such as alerts, frames, dropdowns, drag and drop, etc.
- Demonstrates various testing scenarios such as login, file upload, form submission, etc.
  
## SpeedTest Automation Project

This project is a Selenium-based automated testing framework for SpeedTest, a web application that measures the internet speed and performance. The project uses Java as the programming language, Maven as the build tool, TestNG as the testing framework, and Allure as the reporting tool. The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, which enables structured and maintainable test code by separating page objects from test logic, enhancing reusability and scalability.

The project covers various functionalities of the website, such as:

- Launching the website on different browsers
- Clicking on the Go button to start the speed test
- Waiting for the test to complete
- Verifying the ping, download, and upload speed values
- Clicking on the feedback button to submit feedback

The project also supports parallel testing , which allows running tests on multiple browsers simultaneously. The project also uses annotations to speed up the test development and execution.
The project can be used to demonstrate the skills and knowledge of Selenium automation testing and to practice test cases on a realistic web application.

## Report
- After the execution, the HTML report will be generated in the test-output folder
- The report will show the test results, screenshots and logs for each test case
